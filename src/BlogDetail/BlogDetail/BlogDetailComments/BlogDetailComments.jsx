                        <p>Outdoor play is crucial for a child's overall development. It helps improve physical strength,
                            coordination, and balance while also promoting mental well-being.
                            Kids who play outside regularly are more likely to develop strong social skills and a love for nature. Additionally,
                            outdoor play reduces screen time, helping to improve sleep patterns and reduce the risk of obesity.
                            With the right toys, outdoor play can be both fun and safe.
